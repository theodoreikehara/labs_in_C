### About:
Our goal in this project is to build an Integer List ADT in C and use it to indirectly alphabetize
the lines in a file. This ADT module will also be used (with some modifications) in future
programming assignments, so you should test it thoroughly, even though not all of its features will
be used here. Begin by reading the handout ADT.pdf
posted on the class webpage for a thorough explanation of the programming practices and conventions
required for implementing ADTs in C in this class.

### How to run:
This program is to be ran in the terminal using the make file in the directory

- *make* This makes all the executables
- *make clean* This cleans all the generated files

- *./Lex [input.txt] [output.txt]* This will run the code that was generated

#### example:
./Lex in1.txt out1.txt

##### BUGS
No known bugs!!
