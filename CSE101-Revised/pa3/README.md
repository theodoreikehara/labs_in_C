### About:
Depth First Search and Shortest Paths
In this assignment you will build a Graph module in C that implements the Depth First Search (DFS)
algorithm. You will use your Graph module to find the strongly connected components of a digraph. Read
the handout on graph algorithms, and sections 22.3-22.5 of the text. Also see the pseudo-code posted on
the class webpage at Examples/Pseudo-Code/GraphAlgorithms.

### How to run:
This program is to be ran in the terminal using the make file in the directory

- *make* This makes all the executables
- *make clean* This cleans all the generated files

- *./FindComponents [input.txt] [output.txt]* This will run the code that was generated

#### example:
./FindComponents in1.txt out1.txt

##### BUGS
Grading script says there is something wrong with size but I cannot determine
what is wrong.
