## Author: Theodore Ikehara, CruzId: tikehara

### About:
In this project you will create a new, and somewhat different integer List ADT, this time in C++.
You will use this List to perform shuffling operations, and determine how many shuffles are
necessary to bring a List back into its original order. Begin by carefully reviewing Queue and Stack
examples posted on the webpage in Examples/C++. These examples establish our norms and conventions
for building ADTs in the C++ language. Also read the handout ADTs in C++. The header file List.h has
also been posted at Examples/pa5, along with a test client, some output files and a Makefile for
this project.

### How to run:
This program is to be ran in the terminal using the make file in the directory
The input file also needs to be in the directory

- *make* This makes all the executables
- *make clean* This cleans all the generated files

- *./shuffle* This will run the code that was generated

### Included Files:

- *README* : Written by you, a catalog of submitted files and any notes to the grader
- *Makefile* : Provided, alter as you see fit
- *List.h* : Provided, do not alter
- *List.cpp* : Written by you, most of the work in this assignment
- *ListTest.cpp* : Written by you, a test harness for your List
- *Shuffle.cpp* : Written by you

#### example:
./shuffle [input] [output]

##### BUGS
Currently have valgrind errors but working on it
