### About:
In this project we will create a program that is very similar in operation to pa1, this time in C++.
The main program will be called Order.c, and will use a Dictionary ADT based on a Binary Search
Tree.

### How to run:
This program is to be ran in the terminal using the make file in the directory
The input file also needs to be in the directory

- *make* This makes all the executables
- *make clean* This cleans all the generated files

- *./Order* This will run the code that was generated

### Included Files:

- *README* Written by you, a catalog of submitted files and any notes to the grader
- *Makefile* Provided, alter as you see fit
- *Dictionary.h* Provided, you may alter the "helper functions" section, but nothing else
- *Dictionary.cpp* Written by you, the majority of work for this project
- *DictionaryTest.cpp* Written by you, your test client of the Dictionary ADT
- *Order.cpp* Written by you, the client for this project

#### example:
./Order [input] [output]

##### BUGS
Currently have valgrind errors but working on it
