# Assignment 3 Sroting: Putting your affairs in order
---
## About
This assignment we implement 4 different kinds of sorting meathods and collect
data on how they perform. Each of the sorting meathods we use here work
differently from one another and perform differently as well.
## Running
This is compiled using the make file
- *make* does the same thing as make all
- *make all* compiles all the dependencies
- *make clean* removes all the .o files
- *make format* formats all the .c and .h files
## How to use:
After running either *make* or *make all* you can type *./sorting* with an
OPTION shown below.
### OPTIONS:
- -a: enables all the sorting functions
- -h: enables the heap sort function
- -i: enables the insert sort function
- -b: enables the batcher sort function
- -q: enables the quick sort function
- -r: sets the random see (default is set to 13371453)
- -n: sets the array size (default is set to 100)
- -p: sets the elements that the command prints
- -H: displays the help command
